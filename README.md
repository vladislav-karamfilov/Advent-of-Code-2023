# Advent of Code 2023

This repo holds the solutions of the puzzles from the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) event.

---

All puzzle solutions are C# console apps that you can run in Visual Studio (opening the [AdventOfCode.sln](https://github.com/vladislav-karamfilov/Advent-of-Code-2023/blob/main/AdventOfCode2023.sln) file) or in your favorite terminal (using [`dotnet run`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run)).

The puzzle texts and inputs are in a git submodule and are not public because of the [copyright rules of Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about#faq_copying). You can find all puzzle texts in the [Advent of Code 2023 calendar](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Puzzle inputs specific to you will be available when you log in.

While solving the puzzles from the event I strived to:
- play with C#/.NET features from latest versions like [collection expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/collection-expressions), [`{readonly} record struct`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/record), [`Span<T>`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.span-1?view=net-8.0), [list patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/patterns#list-patterns), etc.
- write efficient (almost) allocation-free code at some places (much less than I wanted in the first place :confused: but I had to be practical :dart:)
- practice solving problems with more algorithmic aspect than my everyday job (learnt some cool new algorithms)
- have fun coding!
